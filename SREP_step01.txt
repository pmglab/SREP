### SREP First section###
Be noticed, this section you need to obtain the single-cell sequencing data based candidate genes by yourself.

According to our study decribed, the cell-type occupied a relatively position and based on prior-knowledge in cancer single-cell atlas may be more relevant to cancer progress.
Different cancer types have different situation, readers need to make your project according to your detail plan.

As for single-cell data analysis, 10x Genomics can enable you to process your single cell gene expression data.(https://www.10xgenomics.com/)
